Time management:


Email:
reply vs reply all
change subject line as context changes
Brief body
Before send - spell check, recepients

1-1:
Less interruptions between person
Keep a note of topics to be discussed

Positive procrastination:
Commit to a future date - schedule it before the deadline date to have a buffer time
Commit to the schedule
Perhaps list for things you might work, but can't commit

Voice mail and expectations:
Auto response OOO email setup
Precise about when will get back or when it'll be done
Written guidelines about expectations from me to others

Overwhelming:
'Having too much to do' and 'life events' are two reasons
Keep email inbox clean and uptodate
Deligate or decline (can decline with a positive procrastination too)
If life events, take a break
If not reducing, make positive changes in environment and habits or visit psychologists or psychiatrists

Inbox and Outbox:
Inbox - anything that is unprocessed
Communicate with others about same
Outbox - for delivering to others - temporary place - after my inbox processing deliver these to other's inbox

Remove 'busy' tag:
Busy - more works - ineffective
Focus on results than activity
Underspend your time - less switches of tasks
Add buffer times between tasks
Schedule downtimes where you do nothing
